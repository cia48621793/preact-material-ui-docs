## Dialog

[Dialogs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html) contain text
and UI controls focused on a specific task. They inform users about critical information,
require users to make decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

Dialog can only be a controlled component.
You must provide the open prop and handle `onRequestClose` in order to use this component.
