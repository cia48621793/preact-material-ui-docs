## Tabs

[Tabs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/tabs.html) make it easy to explore and switch between different views or functional aspects of an app or to browse categorized data sets.

Tabs can operate in two different modes: controlled and uncontrolled.
- The uncontrolled mode takes over automatically if no value prop is passed to your
Tabs and Tab components.
- If you want controllable tabs, passing a value to both the Tabs and Tab elements
will let you programmatically adjust which one is selected.
