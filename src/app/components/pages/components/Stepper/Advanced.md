## Advanced Usage

The `<Stepper>` can also be controlled by interfacing directly with the `<Step>` components placed inside `<Stepper>`. These individual props are also compatible with the `activeStep` prop, and will take precedence if found on the component.

You can also place completely custom components inside `<Step>` if required and they will be passed the same props as the other `<Step>` children.

These features allows for all sorts of usage scenarios -- the world is your oyster.
